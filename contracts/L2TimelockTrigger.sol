  * @notice L2TimelockTrigger(s) acts as an intermediary between multiple V4 smart contracts.
            The L2TimelockTrigger is responsible for pushing Draws to a DrawHistory and routing
            claim requests from a ClaimableDraw to a DrawCalculator. The primary objective is
            to  include a "cooldown" period for all new Draws. Allowing the correction of a
            malicously set Draw in the unfortunate event an Owner is compromised.
